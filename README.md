## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Trevor

I have a background in text search and scaling distributed systems. I've also been working with dense vector ANN search systems lately and am more than happy to talk about research in this area.

I currently work at [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb) on Atlas Search. I can also be found on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevormcculloch/)
